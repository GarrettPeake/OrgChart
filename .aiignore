# AI-generated ignore patterns
# Generated on: 2025-08-13T06:30:13.636Z
# Reasoning: These patterns target typical build artifacts (dist/, build/, out/), package manager artifacts and lock files (node_modules/, .pnpm-store/, package-lock.json, etc.), caches and temporary directories (.cache/, .temp/), IDE/editor configuration directories (.vscode/, .idea/), OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db), log files (*.log, logs/), test coverage outputs (coverage/, .nyc_output/), and environment configuration files (.env, .env.*). License files are also excluded as they are large and not needed for code analysis. The patterns avoid excluding source code, documentation, and essential configuration files.
